=head1 DESCRIPTION

An instance of C<Hash::Type>  encapsulates a collection of field names,
and is used to generate B<tied hashes>, implemented internally as arrayrefs,
and B<sharing> the common list of fields.

The original motivation for this design was to spare memory, since the
field names are shared. As it turns out, benchmarks show that this
goal is not attained : memory usage is about 35% higher than Perl
native hashes.  However, this module also implements B<restricted
hashes> (hashes with a fixed set of keys that cannot be expanded) and
of B<ordered hashes> (the list of keys or list values are returned in
a fixed order; and for those two functionalities, the performances of
C<Hash::Type> are very competitive with respect to those of other
similar modules, both in terms of CPU and memory usage (see the
L</"BENCHMARKS"> section at the end of the documentation). In
addition, C<Hash::Type> offers an API for B<convenient and very
efficient sorting> of lists of tied hashes, and methods for faster
implementations of C<keys>, C<values> and C<each>.

In conclusion, this module is well suited for any need of restricted
and/or ordered hashes, and for situations dealing with large
collections of homogeneous hashes, like for example data rows coming from
spreadsheets or databases.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

The C<new()> method is polymorphic : it can be used
both as a class and as an instance method.

=head3 C<new()> as a class method

  my $h_type = Hash::Type->new(@names);

Creates a new instance which holds a collection of names and
associated indices (technically, this is a hash reference blessed in
package C<Hash::Type>).  This instance can then be used to generate tied
hashes.  The list of C<@names> is optional ; names can be added later
through the C<add> method.

=head3 C<new()> as an instance method

  my $tied_hashref = $h_type->new(@vals);

Creates a new tied hash associated to the C<Hash::Type> class and
containing a reference to the C<$h_type> instance.
Internally, the tied hash is implemented as an array reference.

=head2 TIE interface

=head3 Tied hash creation

The C<tie> syntax is an alternative to the C<new()> method seen above :

  tie my(%hash), $h_type, @vals;

This is a bit unusual since the official syntax for the L<tie> function
is C<tie VARIABLE, CLASSNAME, LIST>; here the second argument is not
a classname, but an object. It works well, however, because the
C<TIEHASH> call merely passes the second argument to the implementation,
without any check that this is a real scalar classname.

=head3 Accessing names in tied hashes

Access to C<$hash{name}> is equivalent to writing

  tied(%hash)->[$h_type->{name}]

where C<$h_type> is the C<Hash::Type> instance. That instance
can be retrieved through the special, reserved name
C<$hash{'Hash::Type'}>; you may need it for example to
generate a comparison function, as explained below.
The reserved name C<$hash{'Hash::Type'}> can be read but it does
not belong to  C<keys %hash>.

The operation C<delete $hash{name}> is forbidden since it would
break the consistency of the internal arrayref. Any attempt to
delete a name will generate an exception. Of course it is always
possible to set a field to C<undef>.

=head2 add

  $h_type->add(@new_names);

Adds C<@new_names> in C<$h_type> and gives them new indices.
Does nothing for names that were already present.
Returns the number of names actually added.

Existing hashes already tied to C<$h_type> are not touched; their
internal arrayrefs are not expanded, but the new fields will spring
into existence as soon as they are assigned a value, 
thanks to Perl's auto-vivification mechanism.

=head2 names

  my @headers = $h_type->names;

Returns the list of defined names, in index order.
This is the same list as C<keys %hash>, but faster
because it directly returns a copy of the underlying name array
instead of having to iterate through the keys.

=head2 values

  my @vals = $h_type->values(\%hash);

Returns the list of values in C<%hash>, in index order.
This is the same list as C<values %hash>, but faster.

=head2 each

  my $iterator = $h_type->each(\%hash);
  while (my ($key, $value) = $iterator->()) {
    # ...
  }

Returns an iterator function that yields pairs of
($key, $value) at each call, until reaching an empty list
at the end of the tied hash.
This is the same as calling C<each %hash>, but faster.

=head2 cmp

=head3 first syntax : one single argument

  my $cmp = $h_type->cmp("f1 : cmp1, f2 : cmp2 , ...")

Returns a reference to an anonymous sub which successively compares
the given field names, applying the given operators,
and returns a positive, negative or zero value.
This sub can then be fed to C<sort>. 'f1', 'f2', etc are field names,
'cmp1', 'cmp2' are comparison operators written as :

  [+|-] [alpha|num|cmp|<=>|d.m.y|d/m/y|y-m-d|...]

The sign is '+' for ascending order, '-' for descending; default is '+'.
Operator 'alpha' is synonym to 'cmp' and 'num' is synonym to '<=>';
operators 'd.m.y', 'd/m/y', etc. are for dates in various
formats; default is 'alpha'.

If all you want is alphabetic ascending order, 
just write the field names :

  my $cmp = $person_type->cmp('lastname, firstname');

B<Note> : C<sort> will not accept something like

  sort $person_type->cmp('lastname, firstname') @people;

so you B<have to> store it in a variable first :

  my $cmp = $person_type->cmp('lastname', 'firstname');
  sort $cmp @people;

For date comparisons, values are parsed into day/month/year, according
to the shape specified (for example 'd.m.y') will take '.' as
a separator. Day, month or year need not be several digits,
so '1.1.1' will be interpreted as '01.01.2001'. Years of 2 or 1 digits
are mapped to 2000 or 1900, with pivot at 33 (so 32 becomes 2032 and
33 becomes 1933).

=head3 second syntax : pairs of (field_name => comparison_specification)

  my $cmp = $h_type->cmp(f1 => cmp1, f2 => cmp2, ...);

This second syntax, with pairs of field names and operators,
is a bit more verbose but gives you more flexibility, 
as you can write your own comparison functions using C<$a> and C<$b> :

  my $by_name_length = $person_type->cmp(
    lastname  => {length($b) <=> length($a)},
    lastname  => 'alpha',
    firstname => 'alpha',
  );

B<Note> : the resulting closure is bound to
the special variables C<$a> and <$b>. Since those
are different in each package, you cannot
pass the comparison function to another
package : the call to C<sort> has to be done here.


=head1 INTERNALS

A C<Hash::Type> instance is a blessed hashref, in which
each declared name is associated with a corresponding index
(starting at 1).

In addition, the hashref contains a private key C<\0HTkeys\0> holding
an arrayref to the ordered list of names, in order to provide a fast
implementation for the C<NEXTKEY> operation. In the unlikely case
that this private key would cause a conflict, it can be changed
by setting C<$Hash::Type::reserved_keys_field> to a different value.

Tied hashes are implemented as arrayrefs, in which slot 0 points

to the C<Hash::Type> instance, and slots 1 to I<n> are the values
for the named fields.

The particular thing about this module is that it has two different
families of instances blessed into the same class :

=over

=item *

blessed hashrefs are "types", holding a collection of field names,
answering to object-oriented methods of the public interface 
(i.e. methods L</add>, L</names>, etc.)

=item *

blessed arrayrefs are implementations of tied hashes, answering
to implicit method calls of the L</perltie> API
(i.e methods C<FIRSTKEY>, C<NEXTKEY>, C<EXISTS>, etc.).

=back


=head1 SEE ALSO

The 'pseudo-hashes' documented in L<perlref> were very similar,
but were deprecated since Perl 5.8.0.

For other ways to restrict the keys of a hash to a fixed set, see
L<Hash::Util/lock_keys>, L<Tie::Hash::FixedKeys>, L<Tie::StrictHash>.

For other ways to implement ordered hashes, see
L<Tie::IxHash>, L<Hash::Ordered>, L<Tie::Hash::Indexed>, and many
others.

The L<Sort::Fields> module in CPAN uses techniques similar to
the present L</cmp> method for
dynamically building sorting criterias according to field
positions; but it is intended for numbered fields, not
for named fields, and has no support for caller-supplied
comparison operators. The design is also a bit different :
C<fieldsort> does everything at once (splitting, comparing
and sorting), whereas C<Hash::Type::cmp> only compares, and
leaves it to the caller to do the rest.

C<Hash::Type> was primarily designed as a core element
for implementing rows of data in L<File::Tabular>.

=head1 BENCHMARKS

A benchmark program is supplied within the distribution to compare
performances of C<Hash::Type> to some other solutions. Compared
operations were hash creation, data access, data update, sorting,
and deletion, varying the number of tied hashes, the number of keys,
and also the length of hash keys (surprisingly, this makes a difference!).

The conclusions (confirmed by other results not displayed here) are
that C<Hash::Type> is quite reasonable in CPU and memory usage, with
respect to other modules implementing ordered hashes. It is especially good
at sorting, but this due to its API allowing to I<compile> a sorting
function before applying it to a list of hashes. It even sometimes outperforms
perl core hashes on creation time.

Among the competitors L<Tie::Hash::Indexed> is the fastest, which is
not suprising as it is implemented in XS, while all other are
implemented in pure Perl; notice however that this module is quite
costly in terms of memory.

L<Tie::IxHash>, which was among the first modules on CPAN for
ordered hashes, is definitely slow and greedy for memory.

L<Hash::Ordered>, a more recent proposal, sits in the middle; however, it
should be noted that the benchmark was based on its L</perltie> API, which
is probably not the most efficient way to use the module.
